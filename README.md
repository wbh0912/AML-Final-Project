# AML Final Project - VAE
Variational auto-encoder (VAE) summarizes latent features underneath the given huge dataset. The respective decoder reconstructs the data with a small loss. In this project, we first review key points in VAE and then apply it to the SVHN dataset. We also investigate different choices of parameter setting and compare diâ†µerent results. Finally, we conclude our work and propose several thoughts for future improvement.

`Project_1.0.pdf` is our report file.

`VAE.ipynb` is the python notebook file. It is recommended to use Colab to run this file, but you can use jupyter notebook as well. It contains detailed comments and instructions. If you follow the instructions within(especially for setting the correct path and loading the data set), you should be able to reproduce our results.

All the references are listed both in the report and the notebook file.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
